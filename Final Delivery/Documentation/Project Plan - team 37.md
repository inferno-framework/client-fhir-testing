# Project Plan

**Author**: Team 37

## 1 Introduction

*Our team is building a FHIR client testing tool in order to help industry members feel confident that their application and server endpoints meet design specifications.*

## 2 Process Description

- **Plan Project**
- *Meet with mentors to understand the requirements for this project. Perform research and collect the use stories / requirements. Each team member also makes sure to clone Inferno and play around with the tool to develop an understanding of it.*
- *Entrance criteria: Meet with mentors and perform research*
- *Exit criteria: Understand the project, gather the requirements, create a list of user stories, and come up with a high-level architecture / implementation plan*

- **Design the system**
- *Take the user stories and project requirements and come up with a detailed design / architecture. Also come up with a detailed implementation plan. Develop different diagrams for the application i.e. system, class etc. Make a list of all the dependencies for the system and sort them out. Lock down the tools, technologies (DB, caching solution etc.) and languagues that will be used to develop the application*
- *Entrance criteria: Project / application requirements*
- *Exit criteria: Design diagrams, list of dependencies, languages / technologies to be used, use cases*

- **Implement the use cases**
- *Take the design and use cases and start implementing each use case. Each member of the development team picks a use case and implements it. Once the developer is done with the implementation, QA team collaborates with the developer and creates a testing plan and a set of test cases. These test cases could be unit tests or regression test cases. The software is thoroughly testing before merge to master. Developer picks another use case.*
- *Entrance criteria: List of use cases and tickets created for each use case with the acceptance criterias*
- *Exit criteria: Working software with all the QA validations performed for each invidual use cases as wells as the whole application*

Once the developer is done with the implementation, QA team collaborates with the developer and creates a testing plan and a set of test cases. These test cases could be unit tests or regression test cases. The software is thoroughly testing before merge to master. Developer then picks another use case. Project Manager also regularly meets with stakeholders to give regular updates and collect feedback.*
- *Entrance criteria: List of use cases and tickets created for each use case with the acceptance criterias*
- *Exit criteria: Working software with all the QA validations performed for each invidual use cases as wells as the whole application*

**Test the whole application / system**
- *Come up with a list of functional test cases (manual or automated). Perform final validations for the whole system. Meet with stakeholders to make sure that all the requirements were met. Give a demo of the application to the stakeholders*
- *Entrance criteria: Developed software / tool / application and a list of functional test cases*
- *Exit criteria: Fully tested and functional software*

**Deploy the software**
- *Work with mentors and stakeholders for deployment strategies. Develop any scripts needed for deployment of the software*
- *Entrance criteria: Fully tested and functional, deployable software*
- *Exit criteria: Deployed software ready to be used by users / customers*
